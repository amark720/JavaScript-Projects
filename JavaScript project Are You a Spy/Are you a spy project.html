    <h1>Welcome to My JavaScript Project "Are You a Spy?"</h1>
    <p>For this project we are going to build a generic website that will seem to
      ask mundane questions to normal users, but we secretly are looking for
      a spy! Anyone visiting this website will be asked a series of questions,
      only the Spy will be able to give specific answers we expect. If all
      questions are answered correctly, we will post a secret message in console
      for the Spy to read!
        Hint:- You can go to console by-> right click on webpage -> Inspect Element -> console.
   </p>

   <p>Here are the four conditions we will check for the spy:</p>
   <ul>
     <li>The Spy has the same first letter of her First Name and Last Name</li>
     <li>The Spy is between the Age of 20 and 30 (exclusive of 20 and 30)</li>
     <li>The Spy is at least 170 centimeters tall.</li>
     <li>The Spy has a pet name that ends with the letter "y".</li>
   </ul>

  

  <p>A spy with the following information should see your secret message in their console:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Jack Johnson</li>
    <li>26 years old</li>
    <li>175 cm tall</li>
    <li>Pet name is "Sammy"</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Keep in mind you can ask the question prompts in whatever order you want,
  you can even separate asking for first name and then another prompt for last name</p>
