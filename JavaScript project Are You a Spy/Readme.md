# Welcome to My JavaScript Project "Are You a Spy?"
For this project we are going to build a generic website that will seem to ask mundane questions to normal users, but we secretly are looking for a spy! Anyone visiting this website will be asked a series of questions, only the Spy will be able to give specific answers we expect. If all questions are answered correctly, we will post a secret message in console for the Spy to read! Hint:- You can go to console by-> right click on webpage -> Inspect Element -> console.

## Here are the four conditions we will check for the spy:
The Spy has the same first letter of her First Name and Last Name
The Spy is between the Age of 20 and 30 (exclusive of 20 and 30)
The Spy is at least 170 centimeters tall.
The Spy has a pet name that ends with the letter "y".

## A spy with the following information should see your secret message in their console:
Jack Johnson
26 years old
175 cm tall
Pet name is "Sammy"
Keep in mind you can ask the question prompts in whatever order you want, you can even separate asking for first name and then another prompt for last name
